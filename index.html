      <strong><mark> Pushpa 2: The Rule </mark></strong> Pushpa’s spirited wife
      Srivalli (Rashmika Mandanna) reminds a crowd that her husband “is not just
      a man; he is a brand.” These are the truest words spoken in this
      unabashedly commercial film, which takes up from where Pushpa: The Rise
      (2021) finished. The story of a humble laborer turned international
      smuggling kingpin, the first Pushpa became the biggest Telugu blockbuster
      ever. Pushpa 2 is more massive, more extreme, more expensive and longer.
      Hugely anticipated, it was smashing box office records even before it
      opened. Critics are split on its virtues, but, as the hero is fond of
      saying, Pushpa rules, and so the film thrives in a world of its own
      making; the plot is weak and confusing in the details, and the characters
      are thin or just plain ridiculous — for example, Pushpa’s would-be nemesis
      is his police pursuer, Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat (Fahadh Faasil), whose
      exaggerated clowning makes him meaningless as a villain. But the fans
      don’t care about story crafting, really. It’s the sight of the invincible
      Pushpa dangling upside down from a Japanese crane while slicing up a few
      dozen yakuza that is what we’re here to see — and action supremo director
      Bandreddi Sukumar delivers as ordered.
